<h3>EXPERIENCE</h3>

**CAE** -- Montreal, Canada || May 2024 – Sep. 2024

*Returning Software Engineer Intern;*

• Developed a Python algorithm to decode large binary parameter configuration files for the Boeing 767 (B767) simulator
by analyzing similar system implementations and applying pattern-matching techniques to extract avionics parameters.

• Integrated the algorithm with NumPy and a PyQt-based interface, to organize data in tables and facilitate analysis.

• Deployed the program in CAE’s software production line, and presented it to 100+ developers.

• Created a tool to automate the transfer of reported simulator bugs from client platform to Jira Cloud using Python,
Pandas and Jira REST API, initially for B767 team, later scaled to all Boeing and Airbus projects teams.

• Developed a navigation performance calculation feature for the Control Display Unit (MCDU) in C++, with unit tests
and edge case validation automated through Azure DevOps Pipelines.


**CAE** -- Montreal, Canada || May 2023 – Sep. 2023

*Software Engineer Intern;*

• Built a data pipeline to process XML and CSV files from the A220 simulator database, using SQLite for temporary data
storage, pandas, lxml, and adapted file contents to meet system requirements. Tested functionality with pytest.

• Tested and Resolved B767 simulator bugs by understanding system architecture and logic and optimizing C++ code.

• Migrated 70% of Airbus 220 simulator code for avionic components from Perlscript/Fortran to C++ and C#/.NET,
improving time complexity and ensuring integration with existing codebase.

**McGill Robotics Team** -- Montreal, Canada || Sep.2022 - May 2023

*Software Developer* 

• Enhanced the Mars Rover’s arm software on an Ubuntu Linux platform using C and C++, achieving a 30% increase in
control precision and a 25% enhancement in the kinematic chain’s generalizability, enabling more accurate movements.

• Developed C++ modules for improved tracking camera data collection and deployed SLAM/ICP algorithms for precise
3D mapping on Linux, significantly boosting the rover’s navigational accuracy and environmental mapping efficiency
